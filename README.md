# Cooking-forum-website: Let's Cook!
This was my first time to take responsibility of making the whole front-end part for a website, it was a great begining:) 

To open it: 
- You should install xampp 
- Put the project directory in htdocs folder
- Import the database (project_it.sql) in phpmyadmin
- then open the website by the local host of xampp

Enjoy!

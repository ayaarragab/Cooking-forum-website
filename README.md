This was my first time to take responsibility of making the whole front-end part for a project, although it was really simple, but it is a good begining:) 

To open it: 
- You should install xampp 
- Put the project directory in htdocs folder
- Import the database in phpmyadmin
- then open the website by the local host of xampp
Enjoy!
